     For example, if they weight 100 to 109 they are placed in the 100 weight group, 110-119 = 110 weight group, etc.
A. 
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS patients_in_group,

FROM patients
GROUP BY weight_group
ORDER BY weight_group DESC;


2 Q. Show patient_id, weight, height, isObese from the patients table. Display isObese as a boolean 0 or 1.

FROM patients;
