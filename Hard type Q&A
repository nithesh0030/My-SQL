SELECT patient_id, weight, height,

FROM patients;

FROM patients p
  JOIN admissions a ON a.patient_id = p.patient_id
  JOIN doctors ph ON ph.doctor_id = a.attending_doctor_id
WHERE
  ph.first_name = 'Lisa' and

  ) AS temp_password
FROM patients P
  JOIN admissions A ON A.patient_id = P.patient_id;
